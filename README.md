## simple site for my binomial-expansion repository.


- run the following commands
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/riyuu-kami/binomial-expansion-basic-site.git
```
- make sure you're in the site folder and run
```ruby
gcc -o expansion expansion.cpp
```

#### this creates a compiled form of the cpp file, make sure it's in the site folder and delete expansion.cpp since it's no longer necessary

- navigate to the site folder in cmd, or just open it in file explorer, hit ctrl + L and type cmd and run
```ruby
python3 server.py
```
- go to your browser and search for http://localhost:8080/
